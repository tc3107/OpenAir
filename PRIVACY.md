# Privacy Policy

This app does not collect, store, or share any personal data.

The app retrieves public radio station metadata (such as station names and stream URLs) from the Radio Browser service.

When a user plays a station, the app connects directly to the radio station’s streaming server to play the audio stream.

If system backup is enabled on the device (for example Seedvault), only playlist data (including favorites and recents) is included in backups.

No user identifiers, analytics data, or tracking information are collected or transmitted by the developer.

No advertising or third-party analytics SDKs are used.

For questions or issues, users can contact the developer via the project’s GitHub repository.
