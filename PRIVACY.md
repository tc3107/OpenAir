# Privacy Policy – OpenAir

**Effective Date:** February 19, 2026

OpenAir is an open-source internet radio application. This app is designed to stream publicly available radio stations and does not collect, store, or share personal data.

## Information Collection and Use

OpenAir does not collect personal information, user identifiers, analytics data, or tracking data.

No advertising SDKs or third-party analytics services are integrated into the app.

## Radio Station Data

The app retrieves publicly available radio station metadata (such as station names, tags, and stream URLs) from the Radio Browser service.

When a user plays a station, the app connects directly to the selected station’s streaming server to play audio. The developer does not proxy, monitor, or record these connections.

## Location Permission (Optional)

OpenAir may request access to the device’s location to improve user experience (for example, suggesting stations based on region).

- Location access is optional.
- Location data is processed locally on the device.
- Location information is not stored, transmitted, or shared with the developer or third parties.

Users may deny or revoke this permission at any time through their device settings.

## Internet Access

The app requires internet access solely to:

- Retrieve radio station listings
- Stream audio content

No personal data is transmitted to the developer.

## Local Data Storage and Backups

The app stores user preferences locally on the device, such as:

- Favorite stations
- Recently played stations

If system backup is enabled on the device (for example, Android Backup or Seedvault), this playlist data may be included in device backups. The developer does not have access to this data.

## File Exports

If the app provides file export functionality, exported files are saved locally on the user’s device. These files are not uploaded or shared by the developer.

## Children’s Privacy

OpenAir does not knowingly collect personal data from children under the age of 13.
